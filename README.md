# Ensea-SH-Tp1
Synthesis Practical Work

CÃ©dric JOVENET, Marin KERBORIOU


 ## Objectives : Develop a tiny shell, that displays exit codes and execution times of launched programs

 We created this shell progresively by following the questions of the TP, therefore the last version of our shell corresponds to the source code file named with the most avanced question number (q7.c).

## Setting up the shell

### installing packages

- Install fortune package : 

 `sudo apt-get install fortune-mod fortunes`


### Compilation and lunch

 - To compile the shell, go to the project directory and use : 
 
 `gcc -o name_of_executable_file qX.c`
 
then, to lunch the shell : 

`./name_of_executable_fil`

## How to use this shell 

You can use any command with parameters or not. In the next prompt, the shell will show the exit code or exit signal along with the time it took to execute the prvious command.
