# Ensea-SH-Tp1
Synthesis Practical Work
CÃ©dric JOVENET, Marin KERBORIOU


 Objectives : Develop a tiny shell, that displays exit codes and execution times of launched
 programs

 We created this shell progresively by following the questions of the TP, therefore the last version of our shell corresponds to the source code file named with the most avanced question number (q7.c).

 To compile the shell, go to the project directory and use : 
 
 gcc -o name_of_executable_file qX.c
 
then, to lunch the shell : 

./name_of_executable_fil
